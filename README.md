<br>
The aim of this project is to apply a [two-level degradation algorithm](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Image-compression-and-subjective-quality-assessment/tree/main/main.py) on [10 images](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Image-compression-and-subjective-quality-assessment/tree/main/Original%20images) ([JPEG compression](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cerl/reliablejpeg/compression/)).
<br>
After applying this algorithm, some users (24) were asked to give their personal opinion (opinion score, OS) on the quality of such damaged images ([module link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sbGq9buDY81KzAQer61JFAOOB_Cx7w-6KJtURkBYlQM/edit?usp=sharing)).
<br>
Subsequently, some [statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KzE92K5fdU3O7zQb6gbgB_71cHL2H_fhqHaPDHUbvUY/edit?usp=sharing) were automatically made on these obtained data.
<br>
Finally, the results are studied in depth, to better understand why some images have confused most users.

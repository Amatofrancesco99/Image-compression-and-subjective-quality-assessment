<br>
The aim of this project is to apply a degradation algorithm on 10 images (JPEG compression).
<br>
After applying this algorithm, some users (24) were asked to give their personal opinion (opinion score, OS) on the quality of such damaged images.
<br>
Subsequently, some statistics were made on these obtained data.
<br>
Finally, the results are studied in depth to better understand why some images have confused our users the most.
